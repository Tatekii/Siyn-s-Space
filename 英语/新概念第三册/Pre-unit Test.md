	>The circus act was nothing short of breathtaking. A man confidently walked on a tightrope high above the ground, his steps steady and precise. As the crowd watched in awe, he mounted a one-wheel bicycle and began riding across the rope. To everyone’s amazement, he balanced two other performers on his shoulders while pedaling carefully. The audience held their breath as he moved forward, showcasing incredible strength and skill. When he reached the other side safely, the crowd erupted into applause, cheering and clapping for the daring performance they had just witnessed.

1. The man returned to give a repeat performance ——tight-rope again ——he did a hand-stand on the one-wheel bicycle ——lost his balance ——the crowd gasped ——the man grabbed the tight-rope:— he was still holding on to the bicycle ——climbed on again and rode to the other side.
	>The man returned for a second act, eager to astonish the crowd again. This time, he repeated the tightrope crossing on the one-wheel bicycle but added a daring twist. Halfway across, he performed a handstand on the bicycle, stunning the audience. Suddenly, he lost his balance, and the crowd gasped in alarm. However, the man quickly grabbed the tightrope with his hands, skillfully holding on to the bicycle as well. With extraordinary composure, he climbed back onto the bicycle and completed the act by riding to the other side. The crowd cheered louder than ever, amazed by his resilience and bravery.
